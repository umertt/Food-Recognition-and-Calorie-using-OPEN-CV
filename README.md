# Food-Recognition-and-Calorie-using-OPEN-CV

This project uses OpenCV to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content based on predefined nutritional data. It combines computer vision techniques with a basic calorie mapping system to assist in dietary tracking and food analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Features
 Detects and classifies food items using image processing

Supports image input (webcam or uploaded image)

 Estimates calories based on recognized food types

 Calorie data mapped from a simple database/dictionary

 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

TensorFlow

ðŸ§  How It Works
Image Input: Capture or upload an image of food.

Preprocessing: Apply filters, contours, or segmentation using OpenCV.

Recognition: Identify the food item (via shape/color/features or optional ML model).

Calorie Estimation: Match the item to a calorie value using a lookup table.
